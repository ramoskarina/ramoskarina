### Hi there 👋

I am a Biologist specialist in Brazilian venomous and poisonous animals and mosquitoes of medical importance, with a Master's degree in Science (University of Sao Paulo - USP). Actually I am also an undergraduate in Data Science, passionate about all the infinite possibilities that we can reach with data analysis.

Here you can find some of my projets in English and Portuguese versions. Feel free to contact me if you have any question about them or about me.

- 🔭 In my academic carrer I used to work with mosquitoes, climate, social variables, and <i>Aedes aegypti</i> epidemiology.
- 🌱Today I'm concentrated about learning R, Python, SQL and Neural Networks.
- 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on data science and data analysis projects :)
