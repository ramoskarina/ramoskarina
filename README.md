### Hi there 👋

I am a Biologist specialist in Brazilian venomous and poisonous animals and mosquitoes of medical importance, with a Master's in Science (University of Sao Paulo - USP). I am also an undergraduate in Data Science, passionate about all the infinite possibilities we can reach with data analysis. Here, you can find some of my projects in English and Portuguese. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions about them or about me.

🔭 In my academic career I used to work with mosquitoes, climate, social variables, and Aedes aegypti epidemiology.
🌱Today I'm updating my skills in R, Python, SQL, and Neural Networks.
🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on data science and data analysis projects :)
